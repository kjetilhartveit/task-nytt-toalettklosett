# Update internal documentation

## Instructions

- Check [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md) and make sure that they are up-to-date with the current state of the application.
- We don't want to re-write large parts of the files, but rather correct, add or delete information which is now out-dated or incorrect.

## Examples

- If the listed current tech stack is out-dated, then feel free to update it.
- If a mentioned npm/pnpm script no longer exists then remove it or correct it.
- If a common code file has changed its contents and the information about it in the AGENTS.md file is now out-dated then update it.
- If a common code file or folder has been added or deleted then update it if it's out-dated.
- You may not make changes to "subjective" information like the feedback loop, code conventions or instructions regarding the AI-generated commit messages.
